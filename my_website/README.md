# My Website/ Joshuarushford.com
#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WqtrKE2Pq0
#### Description:
This is a basic personal resume website. It's use is to display my programming skills to employers.
There is a "home" page where a description of the website lives, a "projects" page where I present all
of my past projects, a "certifications and education" page where I list my credentials, and finally a
"contact" page where I list my personal contact information.

app.py is where the back-end Python code lives. This is basically just the individual routes for each
of the webpages. Not much more was required on the back-end of this website, as it's not a very
complex website.

requirements.txt is just a list of the libraries I used in this project. In this case, I only used Flask.

In the "static" folder is the css file that sources the site's aesthetic. I used a little bit of Bootstrap
code for the nav-bar, but other than that, the rest of the css was written by me. Also in the "static"
folder are the pictures I used in this website.

Lastly, contained within the "templates" folder are my html files. There are 5 in total - one for each of
the webpages along with a template that was used via Jinja syntax to more efficiently create each page.

There's not much more to say about this website! After it's submission I plan to host it on Heroku and
officially release it to the world! What an adventure this has been. I entered CS50 with almost zero
programming knowledge. Now I know 7 different programming languages and just built a full-stack web
application. I truely feel like a programmer now rather than just someone dipping their toes in the water!
